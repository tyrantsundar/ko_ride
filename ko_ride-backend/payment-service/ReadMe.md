1. MVP Features
   What you’ve defined is great. Here are a few extra thoughts:
        ✅ Multi-method Payments (Split Payments): Card + Cash + Coupon — This is key.
            Store each payment component with metadata (amount, method, status, etc.)
            Maintain a transaction group ID to link them together for a single logical payment.
        🔁 ACID Transactions
            Since SQL DB is being used, you can use DB-level transactions or Saga/2PC for distributed cases.
            Example: If coupon + card is used and card fails, rollback coupon.
        📄 Acknowledgement
            Return: paymentRefId, totalAmount, status, breakdown, timestamp
2. Scaling
   Yes, plan for horizontal scaling:
     Modularize payment methods using Strategy Pattern
     Async job queue for heavy tasks (like card verification, invoice generation)
     Payment gateway integrations should be pluggable (via interfaces)

3. Sharding?
   Not now, but you can:
    Design payment_id as UUID or use sharding-friendly formats (like Twitter Snowflake)
    Abstract repository layer — easy to plug sharded storage later

4. Consistency vs Availability
   ✔️ You’re right — Consistency > Availability in payments
   Data like payment status, amount, and receipts must be accurate and reliable

5. Latency vs Consistency
   ✔️ Go for consistency. You can always optimize latency later with caching, async handling (for receipts etc.)

6. SQL vs NoSQL
   ✔️ Go with SQL
   Reasons:
    Strong transactional guarantees
    Relational data model (user ↔ trip ↔ payment ↔ methods)
    Complex queries (receipts, reports, audits)

    Suggested: PostgreSQL or MySQL

7. Data Loss
   Absolutely not acceptable 🚫
    Implement write-ahead logs, DB backups, and Kafka delivery guarantees (acks=all, retries)
    Use idempotent endpoints for retries

8. API Design
   API	Method	Path	Purpose
   Initiate Payment	POST	/api/payments/initiate	Starts payment using tripId, userId, and split methods
   Payment Status	GET	/api/payments/{paymentId}/status	Get current payment status
   User Receipts	GET	/api/users/{userId}/receipts	Get payment history for a user
   Trip Receipt	GET	/api/trips/{tripId}/receipts	Payment breakdown for a trip
   
   Optional:
    /api/payments/{paymentId}/cancel for rollback cases
    /api/payments/{paymentId}/retry for retrying failed payments

🧠 Additional Suggestions
a) Event-Driven Architecture
    Once a payment is successful, emit payment.completed Kafka event
    ✅ Useful for: Notification Service, Ride Service (to mark ride as paid), and future audit/logging services

b) Retry + Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
    For payment gateway timeouts or failures, retry a few times → then move to DLQ.

c) Security
    Validate payment source via token or OTP
    Store only masked card data
    Integrate with secure payment providers (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.)

d) Audit Trail
    Store every state change of a payment (Pending → Processing → Success/Failed)
    This helps in tracking/debugging and audit compliance.
